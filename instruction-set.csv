0,fastadd,2,1,Adds two values together.  Behavior is undefined should the result be greater than 255.
1,clampadd,2,1,Adds two values together.  Clamps to 255 should the result be greater.
2,wrapadd,2,1,Adds two values together.  256 is subtracted from the result should it be greater than 255.
3,fastsub,2,1,Subtracts the second argument from the first.  Behavior is undefined should the second argument be greater than the first.
4,clampsub,2,1,Subtracts the second argument from the first.  Clamps to 0 should the result be lesser.
5,wrapsub,2,1,Subtracts the second argument from the first.  256 is added to the result should it be less than 0.
6,ampmod,2,1,Performs amplitude modulation; if the arguments and result were mapped to unit intervals (0 = 0, 255 = 1) this would be equivalent to a multiplication.
